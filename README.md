# ibm-design
Small proof of concept app for IBM Design

#Getting Started

To preview the application run the following command in the terminal. If you don't already have bower command line tools installed you will need to do so before running this command.

```
bower install
```

This will install all the dependencies for the project. You can then open the `client/index.html` file in your browser.
